# timeStamp
timeStamp project on freecodecamp.
Timestamp service hosted on cloud9 at the moment, but it will soon be be moved to Heroku.

The idea of the service is that you can add a unix time stamp (eg. 1291507200) or a "natural" date (Dec 10 2010) onto the url, and the service will present a json with the unix/natural conversion.
If an invalid date/unix ts is entered, then then the properties on the json will be null.
